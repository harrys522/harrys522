## About me
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on NixOS, looking to become a collaborator and have my first PR to nixpkgs accepted.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Arweave, Nix and soon Rust as these technologies have a lot of promise for future adoption in my opinion.

- Free and opensource software is very important to me.
